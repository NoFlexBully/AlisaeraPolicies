We use cookies in the most minimal way possible. Our goal is to operate the site, keep it secure, and understand basic usage — nothing more. We do not use advertising cookies, tracking pixels, or cross‑site profiling tools.

1. What Cookies We Use
A. Essential Cookies
These are required for the website to function.
They include:

session identifiers

These cookies do not track you across other sites and do not contain personal information.

B. Analytics (Optional / Minimal)
If we use analytics, they will be:

privacy‑focused

cookie‑less whenever possible

aggregated and non‑identifying

Examples include Plausible, Fathom, or Simple Analytics.
We will never use Google Analytics or any tool that profiles you.

C. No Marketing Cookies
We do not use:

advertising cookies

retargeting cookies

third‑party tracking pixels

social media trackers

We do not sell or share your data with advertisers.

2. Why We Use Cookies
We use cookies only to:

keep the site running

secure the site

remember your basic preferences

understand how many people visit and which pages are useful

We do not use cookies to build behavioral profiles or follow you around the web.

3. Your Choices
You can:

block cookies in your browser

delete cookies at any time

The site will continue to function with essential cookies only.

4. Future Transparency
We are building a My Data Dashboard that will allow you to:

Even before the dashboard launches, you may request this information manually.
