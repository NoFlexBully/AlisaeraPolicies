Data Stewardship Charter
A commitment to transparency, user agency, and ethical handling of personal data

1. Our Core Belief
Your data is yours.
If we hold it, we do so as stewards, not owners.
Our responsibility is to protect it, explain it, and give you meaningful control over it.

We do not treat your data as a commodity, a bargaining chip, or a behavioral asset.
We treat it as something entrusted to us — and that trust must be earned continuously.

2. What We Collect — and Why
We collect only the information necessary to:

operate the website and its features

secure the site against abuse

understand basic usage patterns

provide services you explicitly request

This may include traffic logs, cookies, form submissions, or files you upload.
We do not collect data for advertising networks, behavioral profiling, or cross‑site tracking.

3. What We Never Do
We make the following commitments without exception:

We do not sell your data.

We do not share your data with advertisers or data brokers.

We do not use dark patterns to obtain consent.

We do not enrich your data with third‑party sources.

We do not track you across other websites.

If a feature requires new data, we will tell you before collecting it.

4. Your Rights and Your Agency
You have full control over your data.
At any time, you may:

request a copy of all data we hold about you

request corrections

request deletion

request that we abstain from transferring your data

request that we return your data to you

request that we hold your data only in stewardship for a specific purpose

withdraw consent for any non‑essential processing

We will honor these requests promptly and without friction.

5. The “My Data Dashboard” (In Development)
We are building a user-facing dashboard that will allow you to:

view every piece of data associated with your interactions

understand what each item means

see when it was collected

see why it was collected

see how long it will be retained

download or delete it with a single action

Even if this dashboard is not yet available, the rights it represents are already active.

6. Data Stewardship Options
You may choose how your data is handled:

A. Return & Delete
We return your data to you and delete our copy.

B. Return & Steward
We return your data and keep a copy only for the purpose you authorize.

C. Steward Only
We hold your data securely on your behalf without using it for any other purpose.

D. Delete Without Return
We permanently delete your data without retaining or returning it.

Your choice is final unless you later change it.

7. Transparency as a Practice
We commit to:

explaining our data practices in clear, human language

documenting every category of data we collect

publishing changes to this charter

maintaining a public record of what we collect and why

avoiding vague or open-ended categories like “trusted partners” or “affiliates”

minimizing data collection wherever possible

Transparency is not a marketing slogan — it is a governance discipline.

8. Security and Responsibility
We take reasonable steps to protect your data from unauthorized access, misuse, or disclosure.
This includes:

encryption in transit

secure storage

access controls

regular internal reviews

If a breach ever occurs, we will notify affected users promptly and honestly.

9. Our Ethical Standard
We hold ourselves to a simple rule:

If we cannot explain a data practice clearly, we should not be doing it.

This charter is our promise to uphold that rule.

10. Your Trust Is Voluntary
You do not owe us your data.
If you choose to share it, we will treat it with respect, clarity, and restraint.

This charter is not a legal shield — it is a moral commitment.
